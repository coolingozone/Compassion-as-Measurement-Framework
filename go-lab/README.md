# Go Compassion Measurement Lab

This is an experimental lab for applying the
Compassion as Measurement framework using the game of Go.

Go is not treated as a skill training domain.
It is used as a controlled and observable environment
for studying how different measurement interventions
change judgment structure.

## Purpose

The purpose of this lab is not to solve Go problems correctly.

It is to observe:

How changing the measurement intervention
changes the structure of judgment.

## Experimental setup

Life-and-death problems are used as micro-scenarios.

Each problem is paired with an experiment record
in the GitHub Project board.

The problem itself is stored in:

/go-lab/problems

The experimental process and observations
are recorded in GitHub Issues.

## Scope

This lab is for methodological exploration only.

It is not intended for Go training,
ranking improvement,
or tactical evaluation.
